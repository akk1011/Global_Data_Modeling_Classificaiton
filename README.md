# World Development Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is centered around a comprehensive analysis of world development data, focusing on diverse socio-economic and health indicators. The R scripts provided in this repository explore various aspects of development data, ranging from regression and classification analyses to time series forecasting. The goal is to uncover insights into global development trends and predict future scenarios based on historical data.

## Repository Contents

- **Regression Analysis:** Investigates the relationship between life expectancy at birth and various factors such as GDP, fertility rates, mortality rates, and population density.
- **Urban Growth Classification:** Classifies urban population growth into categories (low, moderate, high) based on certain thresholds and analyzes its determinants.
- **GDP Growth Classification:** Categorizes GDP growth rates into negative, stable, and positive growth and examines contributing factors.
- **Population Growth Forecasting:** Focuses on forecasting the population growth rate of India using time series analysis.

## Data Source

The analysis is conducted using the `world_development_data_imputed.csv` dataset, which includes various indicators covering demographic, economic, and health aspects across different countries.

## Key Components

1. **Regression Model for Life Expectancy:**  
   Utilizes a linear regression model to assess how life expectancy at birth depends on various socio-economic indicators.

2. **Classification of Urban Growth:**  
   Implements a decision tree model to classify urban growth rates and explores the socio-economic factors influencing urbanization.

3. **Classification for GDP Growth:**  
   Employs a decision tree classification approach to understand the dynamics of GDP growth.

4. **Forecasting India's Population Growth:**  
   Uses ARIMA models for time series forecasting to predict future population growth rates.

## Technologies

- **R Language:** The analysis is conducted using R, leveraging its powerful data processing and statistical modeling capabilities.
- **Tidyverse Suite:** For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Caret Package:** For machine learning tasks.
- **Forecast Package:** For time series forecasting.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R scripts in an R environment (like RStudio).
3. Ensure you have the required packages installed.
4. Run the scripts to replicate the analyses or use them as a basis for further exploration.
